## Phaser Toolbox

This is just a small collection of reusable objects I made in Phaser(v2) during the year I worked at educational games company ClickIdeia. The examples are just small POCs and by no means finished objects by themselves, so the code should be adapted accordingly. Bear in mind most of the objects I created while I was still learning how to use Phaser, so don't expect a highly consistent code (althought I tried documenting it for learning purposes).

I used my Phaser Boilerplate to create the toolbox: https://github.com/henriquelalves/phaser-boilerplate

The site is running directly from the docs/ folder.
